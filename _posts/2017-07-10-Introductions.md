<p>First and foremost, welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>
This site will house my upcoming assignments for my information science class, INLS 161. 
In this first post, I want to write about what I have learned so far in the class. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
Thus far, we have covered how computing works, both historically and currently; 
what [Github](https://github.com/) is and why we should use it; the different types of creative commons licenses; 
and how to build a website using Jekyll and Github Pages, which is what you are looking at right now!
</p>

<p>
When I signed up for this class, I did not know what I was in for.
I was expecting a dry course about Excel databases.
The fact that it has been so closely related to computer science surprised me, 
but as the class progressed I began to realize the importance of this knowledge.
