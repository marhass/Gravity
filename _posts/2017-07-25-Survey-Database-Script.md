# INLS161 Assignment 4

### Collecting data and making a database

For this assignment, I wrote two scripts that will take user input to questions, save them in a CSV file, then SQL-ize the data. 
The scripts are pretty straightforward and not very fancy.
However, I did borrow an if-then-else-fi blurb from John's script, because for some reason I kept running into error
messages when I tried to create my database for the first time. 

If you are confused by my survey questions, I feel sorry for you, and you should watch [this video](https://youtu.be/IMxWLuOFyZM?t=53s)

Enjoy.
