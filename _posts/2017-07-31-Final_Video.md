# Final Project

INLS 161 is coming to an end. [Here](https://marhass.github.io/final/#/) is my final project for it. 
I chose to make a visual presentation that goes along with Ray Bradbury's poem
_If Only We Had Taller Been_, which he read at a NASA conference in 1971 as they neared their first Mars mission.
